# Predicting-diamonds-price

This Notebook explores the "diamonds" dataset (as provided by the Seaborn library) and proposes an algorithm for predicting their price. The assumption is that diamonds' price depends on stones' size, purity, and shape. It turned out that placing various estimators along with a range of values for their hyper-parameters in a dictionary is a good solution for finding an algorithm that best predicts a target variable.
